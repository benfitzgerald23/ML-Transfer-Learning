# Traffic Sign Recognition
Introduction: Traffic sign recognition is crucial for road safety and efficient traffic management. There are many different road signs so being able to identify each one correctly is pivotal to road safety, so this requires a robust recognition model. This project explores the effectiveness of transfer learning, specifically utilizing the pre-trained model VGG16.

## Overview

Traffic sign recognition is an important component of autonomous vehicles, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and intelligent transportation systems. This project focuses on building a robust traffic sign recognition system using deep learning.
